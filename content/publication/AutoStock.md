abstract = "Stock Market is one of the most common business terms anywhere in the world. There are 60 major stock markets all around the globe, with NYSE leading the charge from the front. Bangladesh's stock market DSE & CSE rank rather behind in the race. However, how big or small stock markets are, they all operate in the same way, a way that has continued for nearly a century now. In today's times, where the so-called disruptive technologies are impacting all the archaic infrastructures that need major reforms to reduce the time and cost - stock market is certainly one that needs a sufficient amount of infrastructural upgrade. Globally, an average of 2 days is needed for a stock transaction to roll out. The delayed time frame, added with the intermediaries fee, information dissymmetry, and inadequate surveillance system hurts the small to medium traders a lot. The big fishes though, stay rather unaffected by all these commotions owing to their long and stretched hands throughout the system. AutoStock is planning to digitalize the archaic stock market structure through Blockchain technology where we will have two parties - Validators (block creators, commonly known as miners) & Investors - in a public permissioned blockchain. All the transactions will occur in smart contracts. Each node in the contract will check the validity of an order before executing it, working as a decentralized clearing network. For adding new blocks to the chain, proof of stake will be implemented instead of proof of work method. Since this will work as a national reformation activity, the revenues will come in the form of cost savings and time savings. A proper breakdown of these is provided in the whitepaper. The whitepaper has been created by team Masala Dosa - a group consisting of 4 business undergraduates who also happen to be tech enthusiasts. The project was a huge milestone for us as it secured the Silver Award in the national blockchain olympid 2021.  In recognition of our project, we were also awarded a notable prize of 60,000 BDT (equivalent to 600 USD)."
