Hyperledger Fabric was utilized for business network governance, offering secure, decentralized transaction management through smart contracts, ensuring transparency and efficiency. Concurrently, BigchainDB facilitated infrastructure governance by providing a scalable and tamper-proof database for managing asset data. This integration aimed to streamline operations, enhance transparency, and address key governance issues across business and infrastructure domains."
