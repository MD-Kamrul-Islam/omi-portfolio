I am a novice product manager, a passionate storyteller, an experienced teacher, a blockchain enthusiast, and, most importantly, a good listener. So, if any of these things pique your interest, I would love to discuss more about it. And if we have nothing in common, I would love to learn by listening to you - perhaps over a cup of coffee - in person or virtually!
