## Iconic Bangladeshi Band LRB (Love Runs Blind) kick starts their 29th year by giving the answer to the much-speculated question on their lead vocalist as Popular music artist Balam joins the band.

LRB celebrates their 28-year anniversary at Café Thirty3 for the first time without their lead vocalist and the legendary musician Ayub Bachchu. The event tagline – “The Legacy Continues” was the audiences’ first clue that LRB were about to announce their newest member on their roster. Although many fans were speculating for Ahnaf Tazwar Ayub to fill up his father’s shoes, the announcement came as a surprising turn of event with Balam (Kazi Md Ali Jahangir) joining the band as lead vocalist and guitarist.

About his joining and the enormous pressure of living up to the legacy of AB (Ayub Bachchu), Balam remarked, “The place that Bachchu Bhai held (in the music industry) , that’s not possible for any musician to live up to (…) There is no issue of replacement here, don’t think of me as a replacement of Bachchu Bhai. I only wish to support LRB to carry forth the legacy that Bachchu Bhai has left for us and I seek everyone’s blessings for me.”

LRB Manager, Shamim Ahmed said, “Since his (Ayub Bachchu’s) departure we had been wondering about how we could sustain the band. Finally, we have got Balam to restart our journey. Hopefully everyone would be by our side.”

He also hinted that, Tazwar Ayub (Ayub Bachchu’s son) might join the band after he finishes his studies abroad. Tazwar has been seen in quite a few scheduled concerts after the sudden demise of his father. Fine more [here](https://app.encord.com/)

Balam’s official debut as part of LRB, might come on the eve of Pahela Boishakh (14th April) although no official venue has been decided. Balam is a renowned figure in Bangladesh’s Music Industry, having been the vocalist of popular band Warfaze alongside a successful solo career. However, Balam has big shoes to fill and a huge fan base to satisfy. Only time can tell how Balam’s latest venture in his veteran career in going to turn out.

Initially formed by Ayub Bachchu, S I Tutul, Saidul Hasan Swapan, Habib Anwar Joy back in 1991, LRB has released 14 albums till date with over 2500 gigs at home and abroad. With Balam’s inclusion here is the band’s current line-up: Saidul Hasan Swapan on bass guitar, Masud on second guitar and second voice, Romel on drums, Shamim Ahmed as sound engineer and manager and Balam as the vocalist and guitarist.
