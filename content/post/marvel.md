## Introduction
During my time at JustStorys as a content developer, I had the incredible opportunity to contribute to the groundbreaking influencer award show, "Marvel of Tomorrow." Amidst my ongoing projects at JustStorys, the prospect of being part of an event where Bangladesh's elite would gather for a night of celebration was too enticing to pass up. In this piece, I aim to share my memorable experience at the event and the pivotal roles I played in ensuring its success.

## About the Award Show
["Marvel of Tomorrow"](https://influencers.the-marvel.com/marvel-of-tomorrow/) marked a milestone as the first-ever influencer award show in Bangladesh. With 25 categories and a prestigious panel of jurors comprising industry leaders from renowned corporations like Unilever and Grameenphone, as well as government officials, the event set a high standard for recognition within the influencer community. The selection process was meticulous, overseen by esteemed professionals who ensured that only the most deserving influencers received recognition.

## My Role
Initially, I was tasked with contributing to the promotional efforts by crafting engaging content leading up to the event. This involved writing scripts for six promotional AVs featuring prominent influencers such as Rafsan Sabab and Sakib Bin Rashid. The positive reception to these scripts resulted in over a million views, generating excitement for the upcoming event. Additionally, I took on responsibilities within the data gathering team, particularly focusing on influencers in the writers, community engagement, and travel categories. Recognizing the need for efficiency, I leveraged my expertise in Excel to create an automated database, streamlining the data collection process and saving valuable time for the team.

## The Award Night
The grandeur of the event was evident as Radisson Blu transformed into the epicenter of Bangladesh's influencer scene. Radiating with the glamour of celebrities and influencers gracing the red carpet, the venue exuded an atmosphere of excitement and anticipation. As part of the backstage team, I played a crucial role in ensuring the smooth flow of the event, having written the event flow script for the emcee, Rafsan Sabab. Throughout the night, I remained by his side, providing cues and guidance to ensure a seamless experience for all attendees.

The culmination of the evening saw deserving influencers receiving their well-deserved awards, followed by a gala dinner that epitomized elegance and sophistication. December 9th, 2021, was undoubtedly a night to remember in Dhaka, as "Marvel of Tomorrow" captivated audiences and set the stage for future iterations of the event. As the show continues to evolve and establish itself as a flagship event in Bangladesh's influencer community, I take immense pride in having been part of its inaugural success.
