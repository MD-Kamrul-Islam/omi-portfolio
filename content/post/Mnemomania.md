## The Ideation Phase
In the early months of 2021, as the Chief Marketing Officer at Prottoy EdTech, I found myself at the helm of an ambitious project: to introduce a novel concept to Bangladesh's educational landscapeâ€”the nation's inaugural Memory Olympiad. The genesis of this event stemmed from a desire to offer students a platform to showcase their cognitive abilities and memory prowess, filling a void in the existing academic competition scene, which primarily focused on subjects like physics, chemistry, and math.

After extensive brainstorming and planning sessions with our marketing team, we laid the groundwork for the Memory Olympiad, envisioning a comprehensive virtual event that would captivate participants from all corners of the country. With the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic, we embraced the virtual format, allowing us to reach a wider audience and ensure the safety of participants.

In January 2021, our vision came to life as we launched the first-ever Memory Olympiad in Bangladesh, welcoming over 1300 enthusiastic participants to test their cognitive skills in a series of engaging challenges. The event marked a significant milestone, not only for Prottoy EdTech but also for the educational landscape of Bangladesh, as it transcended traditional subject-based competitions and delved into the realm of cognitive development and memory enhancement.

## Launch of Mnemomania
The olympiad itself featured a dynamic array of activities, including IQ problem-solving sessions, riddles, and a grand exam comprising three distinct tests: text-based memory assessment, video-based memory challenges, and an IQ test. The response was nothing short of phenomenal, with an astounding 1316 participants showcasing their talents and competing for top honors.

Here is the event introduction video shot at my place:

The success of the Memory Olympiad extended beyond the event itself, as reflected in the remarkable engagement and outreach achieved on social media platforms. During the event week alone, our Facebook page witnessed an organic reach of over 150,000, underscoring the widespread interest and participation in the olympiad. Additionally, the event served as a catalyst for driving growth and engagement for Prottoy EdTech, generating 1896 leads and resulting in the sale of over 500 subscriptions to our learning app.

Mnemomania's first iteration was a huge success and we planned to launch Mnemomania 2.0 in year 2022, and the World Memory Sports Council was even interested to expand their operations in Bangladesh, unfortunately due to lack of sponsors and budgets, the discussion did not continue further.

Looking back, Mnemomania was definitely a mammoth success that put Prottoy on the EdTech map of Bangladesh, under my leadership, the Prottoy marketing wing produced a stellar event and I couldn't be any more prouder for the team effort. A huge shoutout goes to Shreyasee, Deena, Niaz, Raisa, Muskaan, Samania & Shubhra - and of course our CEO, Anjan Kundu.
